# DRACOON C# SDK

A library to access the DRACOON REST API.

## Setup

#### Minimum Requirements

.NET Standard 2.0
API version: 4.11.0

#### Download

##### NuGet
In nuget, you can find the DRACOON SDK [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dracoon.Sdk/).

If you are using NuGet with package management "Packages.config", then edit your project's "packages.config" and add this to the packages section:
```xml
<package id="Dracoon.Sdk" version="2.1.0-beta4" />
```
If you are using Visual Studio 2017 (or higher) and you are using NuGet with package management "PackageReference" then edit your .csproj file and add this to the package dependency group:
```xml
<PackageReference Include="Dracoon.Sdk" Version="2.1.0-beta4" />
```

Note that you also need to include the following dependencies:
1. Dracoon Crypto SDK (v4.0.0): https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dracoon.Crypto.Sdk/
2. NewtonSoft.Json (v13.0.3): https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/
3. RestSharp (v110.2.0): https://www.nuget.org/packages/RestSharp/

## Example

A full example of the SDK usage can be found [here](DracoonSdkExample/DracoonExamples.cs).\
A full example of the OAuth usage can be found [here](DracoonSdkExample/OAuthExamples.cs).

The following example shows how simple the SDK can be used. It shows how to get all root rooms.

```c#
DracoonAuth auth = new DracoonAuth("access-token");

DracoonClient client = new DracoonClient(new Uri("https://dracoon.team"), auth);

NodeList resultList = client.Nodes.GetNodes();
foreach (Node currentNode in resultList.Items) {
	Console.WriteLine("NodeId: " + currentNode.Id + "; NodeName: " + currentNode.Name);
}
```

## Documentation

Documentation of all public classes and methods are provided through the standard `<summary></summary>` xml tags. 
The easiest way to view these is through Visual Studio's built in "Object Browser" (VIEW -> Object Browser, or CTRL+W, J).
